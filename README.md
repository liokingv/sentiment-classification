Sentiment Classification using Averaged Perceptron

The movie review data set contains 8,000 training, 1,000 dev, and 1,000 test sentences and has already been pre-processed. The file svector.py was provided by the course instructor to facilitate the assignment. The main file includes two forms of the perceptron. The first is the naive perceptron which establishes a "baseline". The second is the smart implementation of the "averaged" perceptron which is a variation of the regular perceptron. This script also outputs the 20 most positive/negative words and the 5 most positive/negative sentences in the dataset according to the averaged perceptron model. You should be able to see that the averaged perceptron has an improved dev error ratecompared to the naive perceptron.
